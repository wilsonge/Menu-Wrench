Joomla! Menu Wrench
==================

Pick and choose any menu item, from any Joomla menu, at any level, and render all of them, and optionally their children, as one menu on the front-end.

**Turns this:**

![Items from three seperate memus](https://raw.github.com/betweenbrain/Image-Attachments/master/three-items-three-menus.png "Items from three seperate memus")

**Into this:**

![Rendered as one menu](https://raw.github.com/betweenbrain/Image-Attachments/master/three-items-three-menus-result.png "Rendered as one menu")

## Features ##
- Supports view access parameter (ACL)
- Supports menu item manager ordering

## Performance ##
Performance and memory consumption may vary by implementation.

Stable Master Branch Policy
====================
The master branch will, at all times, remain stable. Development for new features will occur in branches, and when ready, will be merged into the master branch.

In the event features have already been merged for the next release series, and an issue arises that warrants a fix on the current release series, the developer will create a branch based off the tag created from the previous release, make the necessary changes, package a new release, and tag the new release. If necessary, the commits made in the temporary branch will be merged into master.

Branch Schema
==============
Shocking as it may seem, my goal is to also support Joomla 1.5. Therefore, the following branch schema will be followed:
* __master__: stable at all times, containing the latest tagged release for Joomla 2.5+.
* __develop__: the latest version in development for Joomla 2.5+. This is the branch to base all pull requests for Joomla 2.5+ on.
* __1.5-master__: stable at all times, containing the latest tagged release for Joomla 1.5.
* __1.5-develop__: the latest version in development for Joomla 1.5. This is the branch to base all pull requests for Joomla 1.5 on.


Contributing
====================
Your contributions are more than welcome! Please make all pull requests against the appropriate [develop](https://github.com/betweenbrain/Menu-Wrench/tree/develop) branch for Joomla version 2.5+ and [1.5-develop](https://github.com/betweenbrain/Joomla-Ajax-Interface/tree/1.5-develop) for Joomla version 1.5.
